# Configurable `sandcastle` namespace prefix

## Context

Users occasionally want to rename the `sandcastle` / `.sandcastle` naming prefix — for example via a `namespace` option on `run()` / `createSandbox()` / `createWorktree()`.

## Decision

Sandcastle does not make the `sandcastle` / `.sandcastle` naming prefix configurable.

The prefix is an internal convention, not a public contract: it names temp branches (`sandcastle/<ts>`), worktree directories, and the `.sandcastle/` working area for logs and patches. Making it configurable means threading a `namespace` value through branch naming, worktree and parent directory layout, log/patch path construction, and every sandbox provider — a broad change across the codebase for a cosmetic gain.

The problems a custom prefix would solve are already handled:

- **Collision avoidance** — generated branch and directory names are already timestamped, so concurrent runs don't clash regardless of prefix.
- **Isolation between projects** — runs are anchored to a host repo directory; separate projects already get separate `.sandcastle/` areas. A user who wants harder isolation can run in a separate clone or working copy.

The marginal benefit of a renamable prefix doesn't justify the permanent surface area and the extra option on every entry point.

## Prior requests

- #553 — "Add `namespace` option to customize the `sandcastle` prefix" (closes #552)

## Consequences

- Branch names, worktree paths, and config directory layout remain fixed under the `sandcastle` / `.sandcastle` convention.
